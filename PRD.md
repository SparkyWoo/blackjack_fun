Perfect! I now have all the information needed to plan and implement your blackjack game. Let me outline the architecture and approach before we start coding.
Architecture Overview
Technology Stack
Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS for UI components
Real-time Communication: Supabase Realtime for live updates
Database: Supabase PostgreSQL for storing player data and game state
Deployment: Vercel
Database Schema (Supabase)
We'll need the following tables:
players
id (UUID, primary key)
name (string, unique)
balance (integer)
created_at (timestamp)
last_played_at (timestamp)
game_state
id (UUID, primary key)
deck (JSON array of remaining cards)
dealer_hand (JSON array of dealer's cards)
dealer_score (integer)
current_player_index (integer)
game_phase (string: 'betting', 'player_turns', 'dealer_turn', 'payout')
updated_at (timestamp)
player_hands
id (UUID, primary key)
game_id (UUID, foreign key to game_state)
player_id (UUID, foreign key to players)
seat_position (integer, 0-5)
cards (JSON array of player's cards)
bet_amount (integer)
status (string: 'active', 'stand', 'bust', 'blackjack', 'surrender', etc.)
is_turn (boolean)
insurance_bet (integer, nullable)
is_split (boolean)
created_at (timestamp)
updated_at (timestamp)
